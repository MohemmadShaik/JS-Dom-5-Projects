# DOM in Javascript

  **What is DOM?**
**----------------**
--> The Document Object Model (DOM), is a programming interface for web documents.

--> To create dynamic and interactive web applications  we use DOM manipulation technique.

--> With the ability to select and modify elements on the fly,<br> We can create seamless user experiences and build sophisticated web solutions.

--> It represents the structure of HTML and XML   documents as<br> a tree-like structure, where each node represents<br> a part of the document, such as elements, attributes and text.

  **4 Pillars of DOM**
**---------------------**

1. Selection of an Element
2. Changing HTML
3. Changing CSS
4. Event Listener
  
   **What actually we can do using DOM** 
**---------------------------------------**

**--> Simple Example of bulb or whatever clicking on   the same button**
**--> Multiple events**
**--> Selecting multiple elements at a same time**
**--> setTimeout**
**--> SetInterval**
**--> Future Projects**
