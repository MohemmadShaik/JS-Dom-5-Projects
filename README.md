  **What is DOM?**<br>
**----------------**    
--> The Document Object Model (DOM), is a programming interface for web documents.

--> To create dynamic and interactive web applications  we use DOM manipulation technique.

--> With the ability to select and modify elements on the fly,  We can create seamless user experiences and build sophisticated web solutions.

--> It represents the structure of HTML and XML   documents as a tree-like structure, where each node represents a part of the document, such as elements, attributes and text.

  **4 Pillars of DOM**<br>
**---------------------**    

1. Selection of an Element
